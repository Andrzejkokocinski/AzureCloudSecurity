## Instructions

### Exercise 1: Resource Manager Locks

#### Estimated timing: 20 minutes

In this exercise, you will complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Create a resource group with a storage account.
- Task 2: Add a ReadOnly lock on the storage account. 
- Task 3: Test the ReadOnly lock. 
- Task 4: Remove the ReadOnly lock and create a Delete lock.
- Task 5: Test the Delete lock.

#### Task 1: Create a resource group with a storage account.

In this task, you will create a resource group and storage account for the lab. 

1. Sign-in to the Azure portal **`https://portal.azure.com/`**.

    >**Note**: Sign in to the Azure portal using an account that has the Owner or Contributor role in the Azure subscription you are using for this lab.

1. Open the Cloud Shell by clicking the first icon in the top right of the Azure Portal. If prompted, select **PowerShell** and **Create storage**.

1. Ensure **PowerShell** is selected in the drop-down menu in the upper-left corner of the Cloud Shell pane.

1. In the PowerShell session within the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to create a resource group (verify with your instructor regarding the value of the location parameter):

    ```powershell
    New-AzResourceGroup -Name lab03LAB03 -Location 'EastUS'
    
    Confirm
    Provided resource group already exists. Are you sure you want to update it?
    [Y] Yes [N] No [S] Suspend [?] Help (default is "Y"): Y
    ```
1. In the PowerShell session within the Cloud Shell pane, type **Y** and press the Enter key.

1. In the PowerShell session within the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to create a storage account in the newly created resource group:
    
    ```powershell
    New-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName lab03LAB03 -Name (Get-Random -Maximum 999999999999999) -Location  EastUS -SkuName Standard_LRS -Kind StorageV2 
    ```

   >**Note**:  Wait until the storage account is created. This might take a couple of minutes. 

1. Close the Cloud Shell pane.

#### Task 2: Add a ReadOnly lock on the storage account. 

In this task, you will add a read only lock to the storage account. This will protect the resource from accidental deletion or modification. 

1. In the Azure portal, in the **Search resources, services, and docs** text box at the top of the Azure portal page, type **Resource groups** and press the **Enter** key.

1. On the **Resource groups** blade, select the **lab03LAB03** resource group entry.

1. On the **lab03LAB03** resource group blade, in the list of resources, select the new storage account. 

1. In the **Settings** section, click the "Locks" icon.

1. Click **+ Add** and specify the following settings:

   |Setting|Value|
   |---|---|
   |Lock name|**ReadOnly Lock**|
   |Lock type|**Read-only**|

1. Click **OK**. 

   >**Note**:  The storage account is now protected from accidental deletion and modification.

#### Task 3: Test the ReadOnly lock 

1. In the **Settings** section of the storage account blade, click **Configuration**.

1. Set the **Secure transfer required** option to **Disabled** and then click **Save**.

1. You should be able to spot a notification stating **Failed to update storage account**.

1. Click the **Notifications** icon in the toolbar at the top of the Azure portal and review the notification, which will resemble the following text: 

	> **"Failed to update storage account 'xxxxxxxx'. Error: The scope 'xxxxxxxx' cannot perform write operation because following scope(s) are locked: '/subscriptions/xxxxx-xxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/lab03LAB03/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/xxxxxxx'. Please remove the lock and try again"**

1. Return the the **Configuration** blade of the storage account and click **Discard**. 

1. On the storage account blade, select **Overview** and, on the **Overview** blade, click **Delete**.

1. On the **Delete storage account** blade, type in the name of the storage account to confirm that you intend to proceed and then click **Delete**.

1. Review the newly generated notification, which will resemble the following text: 

	> **"Failed to delete storage account 'xxxxxxx'. Error: The scope 'xxxxxxx' cannot perform delete operation because following scope(s) are locked: '/subscriptions/xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxx/resourceGroups/lab03LAB03/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/xxxxxxx'. Please remove the lock and try again."**

   >**Note**:  You have now verified that a ReadOnly lock will stop accidental deletion and modification of a resource.

#### Task 4: Remove the ReadOnly lock and create a Delete lock.

In this task, you remove the ReadOnly lock from the storage account and create a Delete lock. 

1. In the Azure portal, navigate back to the blade displaying properties of the newly created storage account.

1. In the **Settings** section , select **Locks**.  

1. On the **Locks** blade, click on the **Delete** icon on the far right of the **ReadOnly Lock** entry.

1. Click **+ Add** and specify the following settings:

   |Setting|Value|
   |---|---|
   |Lock name|**Delete Lock**|
   |Lock type|**Delete**|

1. Click **OK**. 

#### Task 5: Test the Delete lock.

In this task, you will test the Delete lock. You should be able to modify the storage account, but not delete it. 

1. In the **Settings** section of the storage account blade, click **Configuration**.

1. Set the **Secure transfer required** option to **Disabled** and then click **Save**.

   >**Note**:  This time, the change should be successful.

1. On the storage account blade, select **Overview** and, on the **Overview** blade, click **Delete**.

1. Review the notification that resembles the following text: 

	> **'xxxxxx' can't be deleted because this resource or its parent has a delete lock. Locks must be removed before this resource can be deleted"**

   >**Note**:  You have now verified that a **Delete** lock will allow configuration changes but stop accidental deletion.

   >**Note**:  By using Resource Locks you can implement an extra line of defense against accidental or malicious changes and/or deletion of the most important resources. Resource locks can be removed by any user with the **Owner** role, but doing so requires a conscious effort. Locks supplement Role Based Access Control. 

> Results: In this exercise, you learned to use Resource Manager locks to protect resources from modification and accidental deletion.

**Clean up resources**

> Remember to remove any newly created Azure resources that you no longer use. Removing unused resources ensures you will not incur unexpected costs.

1. In the Azure portal, open the Cloud Shell by clicking the first icon in the top right of the Azure Portal. If prompted, click **Reconnect**.

1. In the PowerShell session within the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to remove the delete lock:

    ```powershell
    $storageaccountname = (Get-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName lab03LAB03).StorageAccountName

    $lockName = (Get-AzResourceLock -ResourceGroupName lab03LAB03 -ResourceName $storageAccountName -ResourceType Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts).Name

    Remove-AzResourceLock -LockName $lockName -ResourceName $storageAccountName  -ResourceGroupName lab03LAB03 -ResourceType Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts -Force
    ```

1.  In the PowerShell session within the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to remove the resource group:

    ```powershell
    Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name "lab03LAB03" -Force -AsJob
    ```

1.  Close the **Cloud Shell** pane.
